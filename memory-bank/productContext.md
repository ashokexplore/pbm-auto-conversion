## Problem Statement
Organizations frequently receive data in various formats (invoices, purchase orders, claims, EDI files, etc.) that need to be transformed into standardized formats. Manual mapping is time-consuming, error-prone, and doesn't scale.

## Solution
An AI-powered data transformation platform that:
- Automatically understands file structures and semantics
- Suggests intelligent mappings between source and target formats
- Allows human review and refinement
- Saves successful mappings as reusable templates

## User Experience Goals
1. **Simple Upload**: Drag-and-drop or file picker for input files
2. **Intelligent Analysis**: Automatic parsing and structure detection
3. **Visual Mapping**: Clear dashboard showing suggested mappings with confidence scores
4. **Easy Refinement**: Intuitive interface to adjust mappings
5. **Quick Export**: One-click generation of transformed output
6. **Template Reuse**: Save successful mappings for future similar files

## Use Cases
- Healthcare: Claims and prior authorization processing
- Finance: Invoice and purchase order standardization
- EDI: Converting between different EDI formats
- Data Migration: Moving data between systems with different schemas
- Report Generation: Transforming raw data into standardized reports
