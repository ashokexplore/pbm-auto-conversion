# PBM Auto Conversion System - Project Intelligence

## Project Overview
AI-powered data transformation application using LangChain for intelligent file parsing and mapping.

## Key Patterns
- Service-oriented architecture with clear separation between parsing, AI reasoning, and transformation
- Template-based approach for reusable mappings
- RESTful API design for backend
- Component-based React frontend

## File Format Support Priority
1. Structured: CSV, XLS, JSON, TSV
2. Semi-structured: XML, EDI
3. Unstructured: PDF, DOCX, HTML
4. Images: JPG, PNG (with OCR capabilities)

## AI Integration Strategy
- Use LangChain for orchestration
- Support multiple LLM backends (OpenAI, Ollama)
- Focus on semantic understanding and mapping recommendations
- Target ≥95% accuracy with human review

## Development Preferences
- Prefer free/open-source solutions
- Use TypeScript for frontend (if applicable)
- Python type hints for backend
- Clear error handling and logging
- Comprehensive documentation
